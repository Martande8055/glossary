## What it is

A data center is a specialized building or facility designed to house computers, most often servers. 
These data centers tend to be connected to high-speed internet lines, especially when focused on cloud computing](/cloud-computing/). 
The buildings housing data centers are equipped to maintain service even during adverse events, including generators that provide power during outages and powerful air conditioning that keep the heat-producing computers cool. 

## Problem it addresses

Instead of every business having to host their own server equipment where they are located, 
data centers allow companies and individuals to take advantage of the 
specialised knowledge and efficiencies of scale of data center providers. 
This means not having to worry about managing power supply, fire suppression technology, 
air conditioning or high speed internet connectivity, for example.

## How it helps

For cloud computing, data centers are crucial. 
As resources and infrastructure can be provisioned according to the [scale of demand](/scalability/), 
businesses can rent cloud computing resources in a data center without having to worry about forecasting 
– and potentially under-resourcing or overpaying – for computing resources. 
As data centers exist all over the world, 
this allows for provisioning resources geographically near to demand 
without having to physically ship and set up equipment.
