## What it is

A data center is a specialized building or facility designed to house computers, most often servers. 
These data centers tend to be connected to high-speed internet lines, especially when focused on cloud computing](/cloud-computing/). 
The buildings housing data centers are equipped to maintain service even during adverse events, including generators that provide power during outages and powerful air conditioning that keep the heat-producing computers cool. 

## Problem it addresses

Before datacenters became prevalent (late 1990ies to 2000s), there were mainly individual computers with specific tasks or those used by individuals to do their work.

But computers have limited resources (disk, RAM, and memory). 
That means that applications running on them have the same hard constraints. 
The size of the application is determined by the capacity of the computer it's running on. 
But if you think about apps like Gmail or Netflix (the actual app, not the interface you have on your phone or computer), those need more computing capacity than any one computer can provide. 
And that's where datacenters come in. 

## How it helps

For cloud computing, data centers are crucial. 
As resources and infrastructure can be provisioned according to the [scale of demand](/scalability/), 
businesses can rent cloud computing resources in a data center without having to worry about forecasting 
– and potentially under-resourcing or overpaying – for computing resources. 
As data centers exist all over the world, 
this allows for provisioning resources geographically near to demand 
without having to physically ship and set up equipment.
